# Tasks 1: Database Design:   

1. Create the database named "HMBank"  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE HMBank
USE HMBank
```
2. Define the schema for the Customers, Accounts, and Transactions tables based on the 
provided schema.  
```sql

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DOB DATE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    account_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (account_type IN ('savings', 'current', 'zero_balance')) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (balance >= 0) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    account_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (transaction_type IN ('deposit', 'withdrawal', 'transfer')) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (amount > 0) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)


```
4. Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the database.

5. Create appropriate Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints for referential integrity.  
```sql

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DOB DATE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    account_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (account_type IN ('savings', 'current', 'zero_balance')) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (balance >= 0) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    account_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (transaction_type IN ('deposit', 'withdrawal', 'transfer')) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (amount > 0) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)

```

6. Write SQL scripts to create the mentioned tables with appropriate data types, constraints, 
and relationships.   
• Customers  
• Accounts 
• Transactions

```sql

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DOB DATE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

)

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    account_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (account_type IN ('savings', 'current', 'zero_balance')) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (balance >= 0) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    account_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (transaction_type IN ('deposit', 'withdrawal', 'transfer')) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15, 2) CHECK (amount > 0) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```
